# MicroComputer Principle Finalwork of 2015-2016B

Final jobs of Principles of Microcomputer in 2015-2016B. Mostly written with C, and also some ASMs.

Here are the list of task.

## 01. [Finished]Install and Usage of KeilC

Just something easier than eat your dinner.

## 02. [Finished]New Project 101

This class will show you how to create a new project based on materials provided by STMicro and Keil C. Besides, the class will also show you some basic parts in a MCU, and how these things work.

## 03. [Finished]Assembly the Fibonacci

In this class, you are required to use a loop program to solve first N items in a fibonacci list. You can use any memory space available as long as you can use it, but just make sure the whole program is written with the Assembly language.

## 04. [Finished]Usage of Timer

The chip you are using, STM32F103VE, has more than one programmable timer of interruption. They are sys-tick based timers, basic timers, general timers, and advanced timers. You are required to use each one of them to make four LEDs blink.

**Be sure to modify stm32f10x_it.c when processing SYSTick!**

## 05. [Finished]Chat on UART

USART is quite useful, especially when your chip needs to communicate with your control computer. Now, you need to write a program to chat with the computer. 

**Be sure to modify stm32f10x_it.c if you want to use 600bps!!!**

## 06. [Finished]Work with LCD1602

Display screen is useful. One of the easist one is LCD1602. It's cheap, and easy to use. Now you need to program it, to let it show letters from 'a' to 'p', and digits from '1' to '6'.

## 07&08. [Not scheduled] Make the Car Move

This is the final stage you need to go! Program the controller to let your car move on, move back, and turn around!
